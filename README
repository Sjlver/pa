  faq
    > how does this differ from pass, passage, etc?

      pa is pa-inless. smaller, simpler, cleaner, does it harder, better, 
      faster, stronger

    > why u make this?

      if you're curious, i wrote a whole blog post about my reasons[2]

    > where are my keys?

      probably in the default locations:
        secret: ~/.local/share/pa/identities
        public: ~/.local/share/pa/recipients

    > where are my passwords?

      again, probably the default dir:
        ~/.local/share/pa/passwords

    > how can i rename a password?

      cd ~/.local/share/pa/passwords
      mv foo.age bar.age
